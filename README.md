(F)orecast (R)eliability (A)nalysis tool(Z) -- franz is a python library providing statistical tests of forecast reliability and associated tools

franz is a toolbox to test the reliability of probability forecasting systems (and related). To use franz, an archive of forecasts and corresponding verifications is needed. At the moment, the following types of forecasts are supported:

(1) Ensemble forecasts
(2) Probability forecasts for categories
(3) First and second moment forecasts
(4) Cumulative probability function forecasts via the PIT
